             GEOIDHEIGHT Implement a geopotential model to calculate geoid height
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, MODEL ) calculates the geoid height as
             determined from a selected geopotential model, MODEL. An array of M
             geoid heights, N, are interpolated at M geocentric latitude, LAT, and M
             geocentric longitude, LON, from a grid of point values in the tide-free
             system, using the selected geopotential model, MODEL.  
             The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to 0.01 meters for
             EGM96 and custom.  The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to
             0.001 meters for EGM2008.
             The interpolation scheme wraps over the poles to allow for geoid height
             calculations at and near these locations.
             Alternate formats for calling geoid height are:
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, ACTION )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, MODEL, ACTION )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, 'Custom', DATAFILE )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, 'Custom', DATAFILE, ACTION )
             Inputs for GEOIDHEIGHT are:
             LAT      :an array of M geocentric latitudes in degrees where north
             latitude is positive, and south latitude is negative. LAT
             must be of type single or double. If LAT is not in the range
             of [-90,90] it is wrapped to be within the range.
             LON      :an array of M geocentric longitude in degrees where east
             longitude is positive, west is negative. LON must be of type
             single or double. If LON is not in the range of [0,360] it is
             wrapped to be within the range.
             MODEL    :a string specifying the geopotential model: 'EGM2008' (Earth),
             'EGM96' (Earth), or 'Custom'.  The default is 'EGM96'.  
             'EGM96' uses a 15-minute grid of point values in the
             tide-free system, using EGM96 Geopotential Model to degree
             and order 360.  The EGM2008 MODEL uses a 2.5-minute grid of
             point values in the tide-free system, using the EGM2008
             Geopotential Model to degree and order 2159. The geoid
             undulations for EGM96 and EGM2008 are with respect to the
             WGS84 ellipsoid. 
             DATAFILE :a mat-file containing an array of geocentric
             latitude breakpoints, 'latbp', an array of geocentric
             longitude breakpoints, 'lonbp', a table of geoid height
             values,'grid' and a even integer scalar greater than 2 for
             number of interpolation points, 'windowSize'.  This is only
             needed for a 'Custom' geopotential model.     
             ACTION   :a string to determine action for out of range latitude or
             longitude. Specify if out of range input invokes a 'Warning',
             'Error', or no action ('None'). The default is 'Warning'.
             Output for GEOIDHEIGHT is:
             N        :an array of M geoid heights in meters with the same data type
             as the input LAT.
             Limitations:
             This function using the 'EGM96' MODEL has the limitations of the 1996
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             The WGS84 EGM96 geoid undulations have an error range of +/- 0.5 to
             +/- 1.0 meters worldwide.
             This function using the 'EGM2008' MODEL has the limitations of the 2008
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             Examples:
             Calculate the EGM96 geoid height at 42.4 degrees N latitude and 71.0 degrees 
             W longitude with warning actions:
             N = geoidheight( 42.4, -71.0 )
             Calculate the EGM2008 geoid height at two different locations with
             error actions.
             N = geoidheight( [39.3, 33.4], [77.2, 36.5], 'egm2008','error')
             Calculate a custom geoid height at two different locations with
             no actions.
             N = geoidheight( [39.3, 33.4], [-77.2, 36.5], 'custom', ...
             'geoidegm96grid','none')
             Note: This function uses geoid data that can be obtained using the
             aeroDataPackage command.

             Inputs for GEOIDHEIGHT are:
             LAT      :an array of M geocentric latitudes in degrees where north
             latitude is positive, and south latitude is negative. LAT
             must be of type single or double. If LAT is not in the range
             of [-90,90] it is wrapped to be within the range.
             LON      :an array of M geocentric longitude in degrees where east
             longitude is positive, west is negative. LON must be of type
             single or double. If LON is not in the range of [0,360] it is
             wrapped to be within the range.
             MODEL    :a string specifying the geopotential model: 'EGM2008' (Earth),
             'EGM96' (Earth), or 'Custom'.  The default is 'EGM96'.  
             'EGM96' uses a 15-minute grid of point values in the
             tide-free system, using EGM96 Geopotential Model to degree
             and order 360.  The EGM2008 MODEL uses a 2.5-minute grid of
             point values in the tide-free system, using the EGM2008
             Geopotential Model to degree and order 2159. The geoid
             undulations for EGM96 and EGM2008 are with respect to the
             WGS84 ellipsoid. 
             DATAFILE :a mat-file containing an array of geocentric
             latitude breakpoints, 'latbp', an array of geocentric
             longitude breakpoints, 'lonbp', a table of geoid height
             values,'grid' and a even integer scalar greater than 2 for
             number of interpolation points, 'windowSize'.  This is only
             needed for a 'Custom' geopotential model.     
             ACTION   :a string to determine action for out of range latitude or
             longitude. Specify if out of range input invokes a 'Warning',
             'Error', or no action ('None'). The default is 'Warning'.
             Output for GEOIDHEIGHT is:
             N        :an array of M geoid heights in meters with the same data type
             as the input LAT.
             Limitations:
             This function using the 'EGM96' MODEL has the limitations of the 1996
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             The WGS84 EGM96 geoid undulations have an error range of +/- 0.5 to
             +/- 1.0 meters worldwide.
             This function using the 'EGM2008' MODEL has the limitations of the 2008
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             Examples:
             Calculate the EGM96 geoid height at 42.4 degrees N latitude and 71.0 degrees 
             W longitude with warning actions:
             N = geoidheight( 42.4, -71.0 )
             Calculate the EGM2008 geoid height at two different locations with
             error actions.
             N = geoidheight( [39.3, 33.4], [77.2, 36.5], 'egm2008','error')
             Calculate a custom geoid height at two different locations with
             no actions.

             GEOIDHEIGHT Implement a geopotential model to calculate geoid height
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, MODEL ) calculates the geoid height as
             determined from a selected geopotential model, MODEL. An array of M
             geoid heights, N, are interpolated at M geocentric latitude, LAT, and M
             geocentric longitude, LON, from a grid of point values in the tide-free
             system, using the selected geopotential model, MODEL.  
             The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to 0.01 meters for
             EGM96 and custom.  The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to
             0.001 meters for EGM2008.
             The interpolation scheme wraps over the poles to allow for geoid height

             number of interpolation points, 'windowSize'.  This is only
             needed for a 'Custom' geopotential model.     
             ACTION   :a string to determine action for out of range latitude or

             GEOIDHEIGHT Implement a geopotential model to calculate geoid height
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, MODEL ) calculates the geoid height as
             determined from a selected geopotential model, MODEL. An array of M
             geoid heights, N, are interpolated at M geocentric latitude, LAT, and M
             geocentric longitude, LON, from a grid of point values in the tide-free
             system, using the selected geopotential model, MODEL.  
             The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to 0.01 meters for
             EGM96 and custom.  The GEOIDHEIGHT function calculates geoid heights to
             0.001 meters for EGM2008.
             The interpolation scheme wraps over the poles to allow for geoid height
             calculations at and near these locations.
             Alternate formats for calling geoid height are:
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, ACTION )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, MODEL, ACTION )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, 'Custom', DATAFILE )
             N = GEOIDHEIGHT( LAT, LON, 'Custom', DATAFILE, ACTION )
             Inputs for GEOIDHEIGHT are:
             LAT      :an array of M geocentric latitudes in degrees where north
             latitude is positive, and south latitude is negative. LAT
             must be of type single or double. If LAT is not in the range
             of [-90,90] it is wrapped to be within the range.
             LON      :an array of M geocentric longitude in degrees where east
             longitude is positive, west is negative. LON must be of type
             single or double. If LON is not in the range of [0,360] it is
             wrapped to be within the range.
             MODEL    :a string specifying the geopotential model: 'EGM2008' (Earth),
             'EGM96' (Earth), or 'Custom'.  The default is 'EGM96'.  
             'EGM96' uses a 15-minute grid of point values in the
             tide-free system, using EGM96 Geopotential Model to degree
             and order 360.  The EGM2008 MODEL uses a 2.5-minute grid of
             point values in the tide-free system, using the EGM2008
             Geopotential Model to degree and order 2159. The geoid
             undulations for EGM96 and EGM2008 are with respect to the
             WGS84 ellipsoid. 
             DATAFILE :a mat-file containing an array of geocentric
             latitude breakpoints, 'latbp', an array of geocentric
             longitude breakpoints, 'lonbp', a table of geoid height
             values,'grid' and a even integer scalar greater than 2 for
             number of interpolation points, 'windowSize'.  This is only
             needed for a 'Custom' geopotential model.     
             ACTION   :a string to determine action for out of range latitude or
             longitude. Specify if out of range input invokes a 'Warning',
             'Error', or no action ('None'). The default is 'Warning'.
             Output for GEOIDHEIGHT is:
             N        :an array of M geoid heights in meters with the same data type
             as the input LAT.
             Limitations:
             This function using the 'EGM96' MODEL has the limitations of the 1996
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             The WGS84 EGM96 geoid undulations have an error range of +/- 0.5 to
             +/- 1.0 meters worldwide.
             This function using the 'EGM2008' MODEL has the limitations of the 2008
             Earth Geopotential Model.  For more information see the documentation.
             Examples:
             Calculate the EGM96 geoid height at 42.4 degrees N latitude and 71.0 degrees 
             W longitude with warning actions:
             N = geoidheight( 42.4, -71.0 )
             Calculate the EGM2008 geoid height at two different locations with
             error actions.
             N = geoidheight( [39.3, 33.4], [77.2, 36.5], 'egm2008','error')
             Calculate a custom geoid height at two different locations with
             no actions.
             N = geoidheight( [39.3, 33.4], [-77.2, 36.5], 'custom', ...
             'geoidegm96grid','none')
